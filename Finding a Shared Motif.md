# Problem

# In "finding a Motif in DNA", we searched a given genetic string for a motif, however, this problem assumed that we know the motif in advance.
# In practice, biologists often do not know exactly what they are looking for. 
# Rather, they must hunt through several different genomes at the same time to identify regions of similarity that may indicate genes shared by different organisms or species.

# The simplest such region of similarity is a motif occuring without mutation in every one of a collection of genetic strings taken from a database.
# We want to search for long shared substrings, as a longer motif will likely indicate a greater shared function.
